# Manga Website

# Overview

This is a personal project used to learn how to manipulate React & Node.
The choice of technologies was React / Node.js and MariaDB for the database.

# Installation
To install all the libraries, please use the following doc in order, 
- [server_setup](./doc/server/server_setup.md)
- [front_setup](./doc/front/front_setup.md)

If you want to know more about the website in details, please check the [API](./doc/API/Internal_API_Documentation.md) or the [Encryption scheme](./doc/server/Data_Encryption_Admin.md)

# To Be Done

This version is still in developpment as several components still needs to be created :
- The reader needs to be polished
- The reader still has yet to include reading settings
- Metadata are to be added when sharing a link
- Such a link should redirect to the correct manga page if asked
