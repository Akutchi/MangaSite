# Manga Website

# Overview

This is a personal project used to learn how to manipulate React & Node.
The choice of technologie for the database was MariaDB.
This project was done with a friend of mine. While he worked on the front-end, I worked mainly on the back-end; although I also touched the front-end (the Router System, the base for the "Reader" part, and all the logic for API calls). 

This project consist in the creation of a website for Manga viewing and was inspired by [Catmanga](https://web.archive.org/web/20210430012045/http://catmanga.org/)

# To Be Done

This version is still in developpment as several components still needs to be created :
- The reader needs to be polished
- The reader still has yet to include reading settings
- Metadata are to be added when sharing a link
- Such a link should redirect to the correct manga page if asked
